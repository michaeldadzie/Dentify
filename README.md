# Dentify
Dentify is a Real-Time Object Detection app that is able to recognize objects from the live feed provided by the camera and is also able to recognize objects presented in an image selected from the device. Dentify was developed using the TensorFlow Lite package and a pre-trained SSD-MobileNet model, which makes it capable of detecting objects in images and from a real-time camera stream.
